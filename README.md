### Simon Alarm Clock.

I've always been inspired by the work of YouTuber Mark Rober, so when I had the opportunity to take a creative engineering course taught by him, I jumped on it. As part of that class I created this alarm clock that forces me to play the Simon game to prove I'm awake before it stops ringing. After I make a few more tweaks, I'd like to order a PCB of my circuit and desig/3-D print a case for it.
